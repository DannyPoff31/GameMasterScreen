### Sprint 1 Summary

- week 1: busy
- week 2: started working on clock
- week 3: continued working on clock
- week 4: took break on clock and focused on the sidebar for player character information and the spaces for npc information.

### What Went Wrong:
- Focused on the more difficult feature first instead of getting some of the simpler ones out of the way
- Many ways to implement a clock

### What Went Well:
- Slivers were very helpful
- Working with the clock has helped me learn about how flutter and dart interacts

### Analysis & Improvement Plan:
- put more time into this project
