### Sprint 1 Summary

LoC: 387
Requirements: 1/7 - 14%

- week 1: busy
- week 2: started working on clock
- week 3: continued working on clock
- week 4: took break on clock and focused on the sidebar for player character information and the spaces for npc information.

---

### What Went Wrong:
- Focused on the more difficult feature first instead of getting some of the simpler ones out of the way
- Every time I added something to one of my modules, an error would likely occur
  - VScode did not always point me to where these errors were

### What Went Well:
- Making modules for each function was very helpful for modifying code and helped legebility of code
- Using modules helped me find where the errors were quicker

### Analysis & Improvement Plan:
- put more time into this project
